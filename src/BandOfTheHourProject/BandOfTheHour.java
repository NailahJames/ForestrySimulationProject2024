Design

Prompting the User for Input
1.1 Welcoming the user with proper formatting
1.2 do
	1.2.1 Prompting the user for the number of rows
      while
	1.2.2 The number of rows is 1 or over and 10 and under
1.3 do
	1.3.1 Prompting the user for number of positions
      while
	1.3.2 number of positions is 1 or over and 10 and under
1.4 Make the two dimensional array that will be later outputted
1.5 Prompt user to choose between (A)dd, (R) emove, (P)rint and E(X)iting
	1.5.1 Case “A” execute adding musicians method
	1.5.2 Case “R” executes removing musicians method
1.5.3 Case “P” executes printing the stadium method
1.5.4 Case “X” executes exiting and stops the program
Printing the Stadium and Weights
2.1 Printing the Stadium assignment
2.2 Printing the total weight on a row
	2.2.1 Correct outputting format
2.3 Printing the average weight on a row (depending on number of positions in row)
	2.2.1 Correct outputting format
Calculating total weight in each row
3.1 adding all the weights in row together
Calculating Average weights in row
4.1 use total weight
4.2 Calculate total weight / number of positions in a row
Adding musicians
5.1 do
	5.1.1 Prompt the user to enter the row letter to add to
      while
	5.1.2 the index of the row is greater than 0 and less than the row size entered
5.2 do
	5.2.1 Prompt the user to enter weight between 45 and 200 kg
      while
	5.2.2 The entered weight is between 45 and 200 inclusive
5.3 if
	5.3.1Adding the musician exceeds the weight limit, output and Error message
5.4 if
	5.4.1 The weight is 0, sp there is no one there
      else
	5.4.2 Add the musician to that spot

Removing musicians
6.1 do
	6.1.1 Prompting the user what row letter they want to remove a musician from
      while
6.1.2 The index of the row is greater than 0 and less than the row size entered
6.2 do
	6.2.1 Prompting the user for the position they want to change
      while
		6.2.2 The position is in between 1 and the number of positions entered inclusive
6.3 if
	6.3.1 row and position is not 0, make it 0. Output that the musician was removed
      else
	6.3.2 there is no musician there so the spot is already vacant
